We have a universal audio player application that can play audio files from various sources, such as MP3 files, CDs, and streaming services. Each source has its own interface for playing audio. We want to integrate a new type of audio device, a VinylRecordPlayer, into our application, but it has a different interface from the others. We can use the Adapter Pattern to make the VinylRecordPlayer compatible with our universal audio player.
